This project is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, built using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and design of YouTube's desktop interface, including:

 Features:
Fully structured layout: header, sidebar, and video content grid

Responsive video card design using Flexbox and CSS Grid

YouTube-like navigation bar, search box, and sidebar menu

Clean UI mimicking YouTubeâ€™s original color scheme and spacing

Hover effects and UI interactivity using CSS only

 Purpose:
This project was built as a way to improve my HTML/CSS skills, focusing on:

Creating complex UI layouts from scratch

Learning modern CSS layout techniques

Understanding real-world design implementation

 Future Improvements (Planned):
Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., working search bar)

Improve mobile responsiveness with media queries

Enhance accessibility using semantic HTML and ARIA roles

Implement dark mode support with CSS variables
